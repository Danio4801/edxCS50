$ code hello.c			// create file called “hello.c”  or we can open closed file with this function
$  make hello			// process of conversion source code to computer machine code 
$ ./hello 				// this is how to run a program 

$clear 				// clear the terminal screen (whole screen, all previous commands) 
$ls					// all of the files in my current folder 
$mv hello hello.c		// by using this command we can change name of the file (hello -> hello.c)(current name->new name)
$cd	pset1			// change the directory to the pset1
$cp 					// copy a file 
$mkdir				// make a directory
$rm					// remove
$rmdir pset1/			// remove directory, if u want to use directory u can’t be inside this dir 

CLANG
clang hello.c // compile code via clang, output: file called  a.out (then “./a.out” to compile; a.out because it is historical name:”assembler output” 
clang -o hello hello.c // compile code hello.c and change output name to hello ( it will no longer be a.out) 
clang -o hello hello.c  -lcs50 // -l means we are adding custom libraries, in this case cs50 
We can also get quick access to the last used s In terminal by using up - arrow once or more times

DEBUGGER
Add breakpoint and then in the terminal:  debug50 ./filename
